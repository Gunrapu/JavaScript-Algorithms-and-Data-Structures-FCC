# Functional Programming Spreadsheet

This project is a functional programming spreadsheet implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform calculations, apply functions to data, and manage spreadsheet-like data structures.

## Features

- **Mathematical Operations:** Supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) within cells.
- **Functional Operations:** Includes functions like **sum**, **average**, **median,** and custom functions for data manipulation.
- **Cell Referencing:** Enables referencing of other cells using typical spreadsheet notation (e.g., A1, B2).
- **Formula Evaluation:** Supports formulas starting with = to evaluate and display results dynamically.

## Usage/Examples

1. **Open the Application:** Open the **index.html** file in your web browser.
2. **Interface:** You will see a grid-based interface resembling a spreadsheet.
3. **Data Entry:** Enter numerical values and formulas starting with = into the cells.
4. **Functions:** Use predefined functions (e.g., **sum(A1:A10)**) to manipulate data.
5. **View Results:** Results of formulas and functions will appear dynamically in respective cells.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the Functional Programming Spreadsheet:

- **Basic Calculation:** \
        A1 = 10 \
        B1 = 20 \
        C1 = A1 + B1    // Result: 30

- **Function Usage:** \
        A1 = 5 \
        A2 = 10 \
        A3 = sum(A1:A2)    // Result: 15
